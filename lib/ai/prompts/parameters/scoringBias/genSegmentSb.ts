        "justification": "Gen Z users (1997-2012) are digital natives accustomed to high interactivity, minimalism, and rapid feedback loops. Studies (Prensky, 2001; Dimock, 2019; Francis & Hoefel, 2018) show that this cohort values instant usability, gamification, and mobile-first responsiveness. They demonstrate higher tolerance for nontraditional layouts but lower patience for slow loading or complex navigation. Therefore, scoring weights emphasize system feedback (Heuristic 01), aesthetic minimalism (Heuristic 08), and error prevention (Heuristic 05)."

    "Millennial": {
        "justification": "Millennials (1981-1996) bridge analog and digital experience, often valuing clarity, efficiency, and information depth. Literature (Howe & Strauss, 2000; Deloitte, 2020) suggests they are goal-driven but flexible in navigation models. Scoring bias rewards information architecture (Heuristic 06) and match between system and real world (Heuristic 02) more strongly than aesthetic minimalism. They expect both usability and discoverability, preferring balanced design systems."

    "Gen Alpha": {
        "justification": "Gen Alpha (2013-Present) are pure post-touchscreen users. Emerging findings (McCrindle, 2023; Twenge, 2021) show extremely short attention spans and intuitive interface expectations derived from voice and gesture-based interaction. Scoring biases prioritize feedback immediacy, visual clarity, and learnability (Heuristics 01, 07, 10). Accessibility is also weighted higher given early exposure to multimodal systems (e.g., tablets, voice assistants)."
