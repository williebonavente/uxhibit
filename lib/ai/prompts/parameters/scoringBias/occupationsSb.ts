  "Student": {
    "justification": "Students often prioritize clarity, guided exploration, and learnability. According to Nielsen Norman Group (2020) and ISO 9241-210 (2019), novice users benefit from visible navigation cues and consistent feedback. Therefore, scoring favors error prevention (Heuristic 05) and help/documentation (Heuristic 10)."
  },
  "Freelancer": {
    "justification": "Freelancers often multitask and require quick task execution with low cognitive load. Studies on productivity UX (Oulasvirta & Hornb√¶k, 2016) show they value efficient interaction and low-friction UI. Thus, weights increase for efficiency of use (Heuristic 07) and flexibility (Heuristic 09)."
  },
  "Designer": {
    "justification": "Designers are critical evaluators of visual hierarchy, color balance, and typography. According to Tuch et al. (2012) and Hassenzahl (2004), aesthetics strongly affect perceived usability. Hence, typography, color harmony, and hierarchy are weighted higher in category scoring."
  },
  "Developer": {
    "justification": "Developers prioritize clarity, function visibility, and logical structure. Research (Brooke, 1996; Nielsen, 1994) indicates that expert users value system predictability and feedback accuracy. Therefore, layout, information hierarchy, and match with mental models (Heuristic 02, 04, 06) are given higher weighting."
  },
  "Educator": {
    "justification": "Educators value accessibility, instructional clarity, and content hierarchy. Studies (W3C, 2021; ISO 9241-171) demonstrate that accessible information design enhances comprehension. Accessibility and error recovery (Heuristic 09) have increased weighting in scoring."
