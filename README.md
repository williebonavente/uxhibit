# UXhibit ðŸŽ¨âœ¨  

**UXhibit** is a **web-based design evaluation tool** powered by **AI (LLMs)** that provides **personalized feedback** on UI/UX designs. Built around **Jakob Nielsenâ€™s 10 Usability Heuristics**, UXhibit helps learners and designers improve their work by offering **structured, heuristic-based insights**.  

Unlike traditional evaluation tools, UXhibit also considers **demographic factors** such as **age** and **occupation**, making feedback **tailored, relevant, and context-aware**.
